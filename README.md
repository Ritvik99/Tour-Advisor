# Tour-Advisor

This little project was created for college evaluation purposes.

The project works on a graph (pre defined for a city/state/country) , different for each type of transportation.
User enters the starting and ending destination of his/her tour and the UI then tells the best transportaion method/route which 
is evaluated on the basis of traffic , cost and distance.
